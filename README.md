# Whatsapp-API - Typescript/Javascript WhatsApp Web API
 
This project is an API that allows the automation of messages on WhatsApp Web using Typescript and Javascript, through the `venom-bot` library.
 
## About the project
The API allows sending messages, images and locations, as well as a menu in the form of a list, with the aim of facilitating the development of chatbots. The project was initially developed using puppeteer, however, as it is a heavier solution, it is intended to migrate to a lighter option.

## How to use
To run the API, just clone or download the repository and follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/FaelN1/whatsapp-api.git```
2. Access the project directory: ```cd whatsapp-api```
3. Install dependencies: ```yarn```
4. Start the API: ```yarn start``` or ```yarn dev``` (for development)
